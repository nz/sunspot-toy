This is a simple app that uses Sunspot to index a Rails scaffold.  It's setup to use Websolr in production mode.

Instructions on using Sunspot in Rails can be found at http://github.com/outoftime/sunspot_rails.  I'm pretty much following that, and adding the websolr-rails gem.

Here's how I made it:

- Create Rails project
- Generate a Post scaffold
- Add config.gems for websolr-rails, sunspot, sunspot_rails to environment.rb, and populate a .gems file for Heroku
- script/generate sunspot
- echo "require 'sunspot/rails/tasks'" > lib/tasks/sunspot.rake
