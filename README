This is a simple app that uses Sunspot to index a Rails scaffold.  It's setup to use Websolr in production mode.

Instructions on using Sunspot in Rails can be found at http://github.com/outoftime/sunspot_rails.  I'm pretty much following that, and adding the websolr-rails gem.

Here's how I made it:

- Create Rails project
- Generate a Post scaffold
- Add config.gems for websolr-rails, sunspot, sunspot_rails to environment.rb, and populate a .gems file for Heroku
- Added haml, optiflag, escape gems to project, as they seem to be dependencies
- script/generate sunspot
- echo "require 'sunspot/rails/tasks'" >> Rakefile
- Add a couple lines to app/models/post.rb and app/controllers/post_controller.rb#index

Start it with:
  
	rake db:migrate
	
	# -- Using local index --
  rake sunspot:solr:run
  ./script/server
  # -- Or using remote index --
	WEBSOLR_URL=http://index.websolr.com/solr/<api-key> ./script/server
