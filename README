This is a simple app that uses Sunspot to index a Rails scaffold.  It's setup to work with Websolr, through the websolr-rails gem.

Here's how I made it:

- Create Rails project
- Generate a Post scaffold
- Add config.gems for websolr-rails, sunspot, sunspot_rails to environment.rb, and populate a .gems file for Heroku
